Hi, I'm Austin ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science student passionate about coding, problem-solving, and contributing to open-source projects. Currently, I'm pursuing my interest in open-source through the Adelaide University Computer Science Club, where I recently took on the role of Open Source Officer.

Languages & Tools
C++: My go-to language for systems programming and performance-critical applications.
Python: I love using Python for data analysis, automation, and scripting.
Open Source Contributions
As a member of the Adelaide University Computer Science Club, I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects where I can make meaningful contributions. Open source has become a central part of my journey, and I'm eager to connect with other contributors and learn from the community!
